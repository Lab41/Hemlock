Your Internet Banking accounts are now setup again for accessing. The
login id is still your main acct. # with the password being reset to the
last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the
primary account holder).  You will then be directed to a screen that
asks for information such as:
Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire.  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive. One major change is the
wording of your accounts names (they have changed to product types and
not descriptions). You can change your account descriptions by clicking
on the Nicknames button and entering your own account description.

We are still working on getting the information to post again correctly
(your old account information has been removed, and we hope to have this
information converted shortly and back on-line), so you will notice that
credits and debits do not show up in the appropriate columns.
Transaction descriptions are correct and the balances information is
correct as of our last day of processing (11/16/01).

We appreciate your patience and continued support. Our goal is to be
fully operational and all information corrected before the holiday
season.

Please make sure to record any suggestions (or problems) that you might
have concerning our web site.  Again, thanks for banking with State Bank
& Trust and happy surfing.

Sincerely,

Howard Gordon
